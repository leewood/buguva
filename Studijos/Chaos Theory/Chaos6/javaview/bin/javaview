# USAGE:    ./javaview [options] [geometry-file]
#           - the geometry-file is optional
#           - each option pair must be enclosed in like "key=value"
#
# EXAMPLE:  switch to base of your JavaView installation, e.g. type
#             cd ~/JavaView/
#             bin/javaview sample.obj
#           or use options like in
#             bin/javaview "control=show" "panel=material" sample.obj

# VERSION:  2.10 revised (ep) Checking for bin/java in JAVA_HOME; new option for fast labels+zBuffer problem
#           2.05 revised (kp) Shortened and doc.
#           2.00 revised (ep) Full rewrite.
#           1.00 created (sk)
# PURPOSE:  launch JavaView, optionally with a 3d-geometry and command line args

#
# PLEASE EDIT FOLLOWING VARIABLES FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT
#

## The following directory must contain the java executable "java".
## It may be empty or commented out if "java" is found via your PATH variable.
#JAVA_HOME=/usr/bin

## Remove the comment char '#' from the line below (keep the underscore!), 
## if you experience VERY slow performance of JavaView
## when z-Buffer is active and Labels are shown:
#_FAST_LABELS="-Dsun.java2d.pmoffscreen=false"

## The following directory is the base of your JavaView installation.
## Default setting: Location of this script then one directory back up.
## You may set it to an absolute path like "/homes/myself/JavaView".
JAVAVIEW_HOME=`dirname $0`/..

## The following directory contains the files "javaview.jar",
## and optionally "jvx.jar" and "vgpapp.jar".
JAVAVIEW_JARS=$JAVAVIEW_HOME/jars

## Set this variable to the preferred language (e.g. de, ru or fr).
## Notice that this option is only available under java1.3.0 or above!
## If JavaView is not available in your language the english version is used.
JAVAVIEW_LANG=en

## Remove the comment char '#' from the line below (keep the underscore!), 
## By default the Java virtual machine has a lower upper memory limit of 64MB.
## Use the following flag to increase memory if you get an "Out of Memory" error.
## Adjust the number to your needs, such as -Xmx512m (= 512 MB).
#JAVA_MEMORY=-Xmx256m

#
# PLEASE TRY NOT TO EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
